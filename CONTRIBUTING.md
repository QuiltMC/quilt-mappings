# Contributing

Our goal is to provide high-quality names that make intuitive sense. In our experience, this goal is best achieved through contribution of original names, rather than copying names from other mappings projects. While we believe that discussions relating to the names used by other mappings projects can be useful, those names must stand up to scrutiny on their own - we won't accept names on the grounds that they're present in other mappings projects. 

We recommend discussing your contribution with other members of the community - either directly in your pull request, or in our other community spaces. We're always happy to help if you need us!

Please have a look at the [naming conventions](/CONVENTIONS.md) before submitting mappings.
