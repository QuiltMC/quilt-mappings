CLASS net/minecraft/unmapped/C_kkdaznyh net/minecraft/util/math/BlockPos
	COMMENT Represents the position of a block in a three-dimensional volume.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>The position is integer-valued.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>A block position may be mutable; hence, when using block positions
	COMMENT obtained from other places as map keys, etc., you should call {@link
	COMMENT #toImmutable()} to obtain an immutable block position.
