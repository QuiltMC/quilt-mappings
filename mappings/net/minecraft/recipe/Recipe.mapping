CLASS net/minecraft/unmapped/C_awrmdwqd net/minecraft/recipe/Recipe
	COMMENT A recipe is an arrangement of item stacks in an inventory that can
	COMMENT yield a product item stack.
	COMMENT <p>
	COMMENT Recipes are loaded by and stored in the {@link RecipeManager}. They
	COMMENT are part of the server's data packs and are sent to the client, governed
	COMMENT by their {@linkplain #getSerializer() serializers}. Hence, recipes
	COMMENT should not be stored, as they may become obsolete after reloads.
	COMMENT <p>
	COMMENT A few of the methods in this class are dedicated to crafting recipes
	COMMENT or recipe books. Users can have stub implementations if they do not use
	COMMENT those functionalities.
