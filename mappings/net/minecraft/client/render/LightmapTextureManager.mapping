CLASS net/minecraft/unmapped/C_grwstqbm net/minecraft/client/render/LightmapTextureManager
	COMMENT The lightmap texture manager maintains a texture containing the RGBA overlay for each of the 16&times;16 sky and block light combinations.
	COMMENT <p>
	COMMENT Also contains some utilities to pack and unpack lightmap coordinates from sky and block light values,
	COMMENT and some lightmap coordinates constants.
	FIELD f_abtihkiy renderer Lnet/minecraft/unmapped/C_sktkdoun;
	FIELD f_iaaiacfc MAX_BLOCK_LIGHT_COORDINATE I
		COMMENT Represents the maximum block-light-wise lightmap coordinate whose value is {@value}.
		COMMENT This is equivalent to a {@code 0} sky light and {@code 15} block light.
