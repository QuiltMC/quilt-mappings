		COMMENT Performs a reload. Returns a future that is completed when the reload
		COMMENT is completed.
		COMMENT <p>
		COMMENT In a reload, there is a prepare stage and an apply stage. For the
		COMMENT prepare stage, you should create completable futures with {@linkplain
		COMMENT CompletableFuture#supplyAsync(java.util.function.Supplier, Executor)
		COMMENT CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(..., prepareExecutor)}
		COMMENT to ensure the prepare actions are done with the prepare executor. Then,
		COMMENT you should have a completable future for all the prepared actions, and
		COMMENT call {@linkplain CompletableFuture#thenCompose(java.util.function.Function)
		COMMENT combinedPrepare.thenCompose(synchronizer::waitFor)}
		COMMENT to notify the {@code synchronizer}. Finally, you should run {@linkplain
		COMMENT CompletableFuture#thenAcceptAsync(java.util.function.Consumer, Executor)
		COMMENT CompletableFuture.thenAcceptAsync(..., applyExecutor)} for apply actions.
		COMMENT In the end, returns the result of {@code thenAcceptAsync}.

	METHOD m_xcuczpmx getName ()Ljava/lang/String;
		COMMENT Returns a user-friendly name for logging.
	CLASS C_yodorvdw Synchronizer
		COMMENT A synchronizer to indicate completion of a reloader's prepare stage and
		COMMENT to allow start of the apply stage only if all reloaders have finished
		COMMENT the prepare stage.
		METHOD m_zhlyxiun whenPrepared (Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture;
			COMMENT Indicates, to the ongoing reload, that this reloader has finished its
			COMMENT preparation stage with the {@code preparedObject} as its result.
			COMMENT <p>
			COMMENT Returns a completable future that the apply stage depends on. This
			COMMENT returned future is completed when all the reloaders have completed their
			COMMENT prepare stages in the reload.
			COMMENT <p>
			COMMENT Example:
			COMMENT <pre><code>
			COMMENT CompletableFuture&lt;SomeObject> prepareStage = ...;
			COMMENT prepareStage.thenCompose(synchronizer::whenPrepared)
			COMMENT         .thenAcceptAsync(..., applyExecutor);
			COMMENT </code></pre>
			COMMENT
			COMMENT @return a completable future as the precondition for the apply stage
			ARG 1 preparedObject
				COMMENT the result of the prepare stage
