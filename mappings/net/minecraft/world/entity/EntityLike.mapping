CLASS net/minecraft/unmapped/C_sncvekqg net/minecraft/world/entity/EntityLike
	COMMENT Represents a prototype of an entity that's suitable for entity manager to handle.
	METHOD m_bjqxzvbg isPlayer ()Z
		COMMENT Returns whether this entity is a player or not.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @return {@code true} if this entity is a player, or {@code false} otherwise
	METHOD m_fbulpmue setRemoved (Lnet/minecraft/unmapped/C_astfners$C_emmohndu;)V
		COMMENT Marks this entity as removed for a given reason.
		ARG 1 reason
			COMMENT the removal reason
	METHOD m_ibdrkofs setChangeListener (Lnet/minecraft/unmapped/C_ylpvpknw;)V
		COMMENT Sets the listener of this entity's changes associated to saving.
		ARG 1 listener
			COMMENT the change listener
	METHOD m_idziptjx getBoundingBox ()Lnet/minecraft/unmapped/C_hbcjzgoe;
		COMMENT {@return the bounding box of this entity}
	METHOD m_jklfpglz getUuid ()Ljava/util/UUID;
		COMMENT {@return the persistent unique identifier (UUID) of this entity}
		COMMENT <p>
		COMMENT Compared to the {@linkplain #getId() network identifier}, the unique identifier is
		COMMENT significantly larger and more suitable for persistent storage. For network communication,
		COMMENT using the network identifier is more suitable as it is much smaller.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see UUID
	METHOD m_jlnbphwa getBlockPos ()Lnet/minecraft/unmapped/C_hynzadkk;
		COMMENT {@return the current block position of this entity}
	METHOD m_kamyxsye streamPassengersAndSelf ()Ljava/util/stream/Stream;
		COMMENT {@return a stream consisting of this entity and its passengers in which
		COMMENT this entity's passengers are iterated before this entity}
		COMMENT <p>
		COMMENT Moreover, this stream guarantees that any entity only appears after
		COMMENT all its passengers have appeared in the stream. This is useful for
		COMMENT certain actions that must be applied on passengers before applying on
		COMMENT this entity.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @implNote The default implementation is very costly.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see #streamSelfAndPassengers()
	METHOD m_msyenvzg shouldSave ()Z
		COMMENT Returns whether this entity should be saved on disk in the world or not.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @return {@code true} if this entity should be saved on disk, or {@code false} otherwise
	METHOD m_pwvaqrpl getId ()I
		COMMENT {@return the network identifier of this entity}
		COMMENT <p>
		COMMENT Compared to the {@linkplain #getUuid() UUID}, the integer network identifier is
		COMMENT significantly smaller and more suitable for network transportation. However, it
		COMMENT is not persistent across game runs. For persistent purposes such as commands
		COMMENT or game data, use the UUID.
	METHOD m_tlvarwdk streamSelfAndPassengers ()Ljava/util/stream/Stream;
		COMMENT {@return a stream consisting of this entity and its passengers recursively,
		COMMENT each entity will appear before any of its passengers}
		COMMENT <p>
		COMMENT This may be less costly than {@link #streamPassengersAndSelf()} if the
		COMMENT stream's iteration would terminates fast, such as finding an arbitrary
		COMMENT match of entity in the passengers tree.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @implNote The default implementation is not very efficient.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see #streamPassengersAndSelf()
