		COMMENT @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this is called before an iteration
		COMMENT has finished, such as within the {@code action} or from another thread
		ARG 1 action
	METHOD m_rgvdtnib ensureSafe ()V
		COMMENT Ensures that the modified {@code entities} map is not currently iterated.
		COMMENT If {@code entities} is iterated, this moves its value to {@code temp} so
